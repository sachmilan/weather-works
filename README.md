## Description

-Weather can be really unpredictable, and it can sabotage ones plans, if they were not planned accordingly. So this gave me an idea to create a weather application, with wich you can search for weather of the given place for upto 5 days in advance.

-To achieve my goal, I created a weather application, In it you can search for the weather of a given place in advance an can plan your plans accordingly.

- With this application you can search for weather of a given city anywhere arround the world and plan you plans accordingly. Its really helpfull especially if you are travelling, as you can pack your clothes according to the weather of a given place.

-Java script and Jquery were totally new to me, so I learned them and used them in a way which enhances my understanding of them.
